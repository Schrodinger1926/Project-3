--------- APPROACH -1 (BARE-BONES) -------

First apporach was to make a pipeline
Trained a linear regression model, with all pixels flattened connected to single output

RESULTS:
1. Bare bones network flattened --> single output neuron (Regression)

TRAINING LOSS  : 322129.4235
VALIDATION LOSS: 691929.9062

something wrong here.

1. Is sample data really suppose to make sense?
2. Bare bones network in correct
3. Data preprocessing


---------- COLLECT MORE DATA -----------

Checkpoints

NOTE: Controlling steering via mouse track, will give fine grained data.

1. Driving straight
2  Trying to remain straight - recover from sided to centre video recording
3. Drive in opposite direction
4. Drive on track 
5.
