--------- APPROACH -1 (BARE-BONES) -------

First apporach was to make a pipeline
Trained a linear regression model, with all pixels flattened connected to single output

RESULTS:
1. Bare bones network flattened --> single output neuron (Regression)

TRAINING LOSS  : 322129.4235
VALIDATION LOSS: 691929.9062

Car keeps circling clockwise. Not a good model, not even close.
something wrong here.

VALIDATION LOSS: 691929.9062


Explore
1. Is sample data really suppose to make sense?
   check video for sample data, use video.py for that
   ---
   Video is same actually, lot of laps.

2. Bare bones network is correct
   Review
   ---
   It is correct

3. Data preprocessing
   a). Add left and right cam images
       Simply append them in generator
       ---
       TRAINING LOSS: around the same
       VALIDATION LOSS: around the same
       

   b). Add normalizaition
       Use Lambda layer for this 
       ---  
       TRAINING LOSS  : 9.82
       VALIDATION LOSS: 6.23
        
       Although I'm not sure how training loss is higher than that of validation loss
       Must be huge underfitting.
  
   c). Add image flips to traning data
       using opencv fip
       ---
       Chek result on AWS

   c). Add perpective steering angle.
       add rotation off set to left and right images
       ---
       offset = 0.2
       Much better! 
       TRAINING LOSS : 4-5
       VALIDATION LOSS : 4-5
       
   d). Crop car hood
       simply slice image (Will add overhead of editing drive.py for cropping imgaes)
       Better, add cropping layer in keras model
       ---
       check result on AWS

   d). Explore if continuous prespective steerting angle is possible.


---------- COLLECT MORE DATA -----------

Checkpoints

NOTE: Controlling steering via mouse track, will give fine grained data.

1. Driving straight
2  Trying to remain straight - recover from sided to centre video recording
3. Drive in opposite direction
4. Drive on track 
5.
